= HQL Benchmark

Benchmark testing HQL parsing and semantic analysis between different versions of Hibernate.
Currently running against 5.x and 6.x is supported.

NOTE: Unfortunately JMH forces us to duplicate the benchmark test class(es) in each
benchmark sub-project :(

## Instructions and notes

### Setup

Before running the first time, you will need to invoke

```
./gradlew wrapper
```
This is to generate a couple of helpers.

### Hibernate ORM 6 testing

To run the benchmark against Hibernate 6.x:

```
cd orm6
gradlew jmh
```

### Hibernate ORM 5 testing

To run the benchmark against Hibernate 5.x:

```
cd orm5
gradlew jmh
```

### Test all versions

To run benchmark against all versions (and create a unified report):

```
cd {root}
gradlew jmh
```

NOTE: In all cases, `gradlew benchmark` can be substituted for `gradlew jmh`
